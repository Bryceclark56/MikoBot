# MikoBot
Miko bot is an extremely basic bot coded in the new python re-write by Miko (@Miko#8008 on discord). This bot has several issues and errors because it is still a WIP. New features will be added as I expand my knowledge on python and the discord.py API. 

# Prefix:
- `m!`
- `miko`
- `Miko`

# Commands: 
- `add` [adds two numbers together. e.g., `miko add 1 2`]
- `ping` [displays the bot's ping in ms]
- `userinfo` [displays a member's ID, name, account creation date, account join date, lists and displays roles, displays top role, and verifies if the user is a bot or not. e.g., `miko userinfo` or `miko userinfo @DummyAccount#1234`] 
- `8ball` [chooses from a list of responses varying from positive to negative, e.g., `miko 8ball will this bot ever be finished?`]
- `clear` [purges chat, default amount is 5 messages, e.g., `miko clear 3`]
- `ban` [bans member]
- `unban` [unbans member]
- `kick` [kicks member]
- `catto` [sends a random picture of a cat inside an embed]
- `doggo` [sends a random picture of a dog inside an embed]
- `duck` [sends a random picture of a dukc (not inside an embed)]
- `warn` [warns member (needs reason), e.g `miko warn @test#8263 being a dummy`]
- `warnings` [displays amount of warnings a member has, by whom they were warned, and the reason, e.g `miko warnings @test#8263`}
- `info` [displays server creation date, server ID, server owner, and server region] 

# Error:
MikoBot sends a message in chat whenever there is an error, whether it be insufficient permissions (on both sides of the transaction), or an incomplete command [e.g., `miko 8ball` (without any question after the 8ball)].

# Future Commands and Features:
A list of commands that I wish to add when I expand my python knowledge:
- tempban
- announce
- mute
- cogs
